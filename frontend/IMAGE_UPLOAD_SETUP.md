   - Click "Add New Product"
   - Fill in product details
   - Use the image upload section to add images
   - First image uploaded becomes the default

    :max-files="6"
    :max-size="5"
  />

<script setup>
import ImageUploadField from '~/components/ImageUploadField.vue'

const productImages = ref([])
</script>
```

2. **Processing Images for API:**
```javascript
// Convert File objects to base64
const base64Images = await Promise.all(
  images.map(imageObj => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      const reader = new FileReader()
      reader.onload = () => resolve(reader.result)
      reader.onerror = reject
      reader.readAsDataURL(imageObj.file)
    })
  })
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Images not uploading:**
   - Check Cloudinary credentials in environment variables
   - Verify file size is under 5MB
   - Ensure file format is supported

2. **Images not displaying:**
   - Check if image URLs are properly saved in database
   - Verify Cloudinary URLs are accessible
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Folder structure issues:**
   - Verify category and subcategory names are properly sanitized
   - Check if special characters are being handled correctly

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking browser console for:
- `üìÅ Uploading images to folder:` - Shows folder path
- `‚úÖ Successfully uploaded X images` - Confirms upload success
- `‚ùå Image upload error:` - Shows upload errors

## Performance Considerations

1. **Image Optimization:**

   - Thumbnails are generated for dashboard display
   - Progressive loading for better user experience

   - 5MB size limit per image
   - Concurrent upload processing

3. **Caching:**
   - Cloudinary provides global CDN

   - Server-side file type validation
   - Size limits enforced
   - Malicious file detection

2. **Access Control:**

   - Cloudinary URLs are public but organized in folders
   - Database stores metadata for access control

## Future Enhancements
